Write-Up

Dashboard 1 looks at two displays of ride times, first a map and second a bar chart. I include a filter on the date for the map and the bar chart is arranged by date for more clarity. I also filtered the data displayed to include only ride times between 5 and 60 minutes long, this is based on my own experience with citi-bikes in New York that lead me to believe that shorter and longer ride times are outliers. We see that by date, ride times are unlikely to change, however ride times do change by location and locations which are further away from the center of our data set, in general, have greater ride times. 

Dashboard 2 looks at a breakdown of members and casual users by street name, as a barchart first, which does not give a cursory user much useful information, but could helped an informed user or local search average member vs. casual user bike usage by street names they may be familiar with. I then show this informatino on a map to provide more clarity. Overall, thier arefar more casuals than members. I for one, am local to DC which has a similar bike sharing program and despite being local I am not a member, so little can be said on this breakdown based on this dataset alone. However, we do notice that their are fewer casual users at the outskirts of the city, perhaps reinforcing the assumption that for a combination of longer ride times and local users, membership may make more sense for users located on the outskirts of the city.
